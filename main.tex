\textbullet{} Predicted and confirmed a possible pathway of \textbf{FullBorene} formation solely from $B_2$ and $N_2$. Results can be viewed at \textbf{\href{https://vimeo.com/user103046658}{vimeo.com/user103046658}}
\newline
\textbullet{} Performed Kinetic as well as thermodynamic calculations to check the feasibility of the proposed mechanism of FullBorene formation.
